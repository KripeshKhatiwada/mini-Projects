# Mini-Collection

This repository contains a collection of small, independent applications and scripts, each exploring different aspects of programming and functionality.

## üìÇ Included Projects

This collection includes the following individual projects:

### 1. `console app`

**Description:** [**Replace with a brief description of what the 'console app' does.** Is it a utility, a game, or something else? Refer to its internal README or code if available.]

**Technologies:** [**List the main technologies used in 'console app'.** For example: C++, Python, etc.]

**Usage:** [**Provide basic instructions on how to run or use the 'console app'.** For example: `bash ./console_app` or `python console_app.py`]

### 2. `grid-snake`

**Description:** A simple implementation of the classic Snake game, likely running in a terminal or a basic graphical environment.

**Technologies:** Python (potentially with a library like `curses` for terminal graphics).

**Usage:**

1.  Navigate to the `grid-snake` directory.
2.  Run the game script: `python grid_snake.py` (or similar).
3.  Follow on-screen instructions to control the snake.

### 3. `mood-logger`

**Description:** A small script that allows you to quickly log your current mood to a text file.

**Technologies:** Python 3.

**Usage:**

1.  Navigate to the `mood-logger` directory.
2.  Run the script: `python mood-logger.py`.
3.  Enter your mood when prompted in the terminal.
4.  Your mood will be saved to a `mood.txt` file in the same directory.

### 4. `task-manager`

**Description:** A basic application for managing and tracking tasks. It might have a command-line interface or a simple graphical user interface.

**Technologies:** [**List the main technologies used in 'task-manager'.** For example: Python, C++, potentially with a GUI library like Tkinter or Qt.]

**Usage:** [**Provide basic instructions on how to run or use the 'task-manager'.** For example: `python task_manager.py` or instructions to run an executable.]

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To explore these individual projects, navigate into their respective directories within this repository. Each project may have its own specific instructions or further documentation within its folder.

## üìù Notes

[**Add any general notes or information about this collection here.** For example: "These projects were created for learning purposes," or "Contributions to individual projects are welcome (see each project's folder for details)." ]

**Remember to go into each of the subfolders (`console app`, `grid-snake`, `mood-logger`, `task-manager`) and ideally create a more specific `README.md` file within each of them, detailing their individual usage, features, and technologies.** The descriptions and usage instructions above are based on common patterns for such projects; you'll need to tailor them to the actual functionality of your code.
